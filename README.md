# ls2json
Converts `ls -lR` output file to json

## Why
So at one moment of time I realized I need to create a jsonfs of a goofy ahh OS and never thought of finding any converter so decided to just run `ls -lR` and on a normal pc convert it to json file

## Usage
Open file `jsonify_fs.py` and replace all my local files with yours

## Outro
If you are unhappy with this crap then too bad you couldn't find any normal converter
